# Unity MultiBuild

## What it does

Provides you with a simple in-editor interface to build for multiple platforms
at once.

## How to use

1. From the menu, click `Tools` > `MultiBuild...`
1. Choose a base output folder (each platform will build into a subfolder)
1. Add the platforms you want to build for
1. Click the green build button

## More details

* The scenes that are built are the ones you've selected in Build Settings
* By default the project name is used as a base for all output, but you can
  disable that and provide a different name if you like
* Your settings are saved in your project at `Assets/MultiBuild/MultiBuildSettings.asset`
* After finishing the build, the active target is reset to whatever it was before
  you started the build
* Be aware that I've only really tested this with the standalone builds right now

## Why?

I often build for several platforms and found it tedious to keep switching in
the Build Settings window.

My first thought was to script it using the command line interface, but you can't
run a build of the current project if it's still open in the editor. It's
annoying to have to close Unity to do a build.

All the solutions I found were either scripted outside as above or commercial.
So I made a small open source version for myself &amp; others.

## Contributing

I'm not going to be spending loads of time on this so if you want a new feature
or you find a problem with one of the targets (or want to add more of them),
please fork and submit a pull request in the first instance. All contributions
welcome!
